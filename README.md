# League Match history/Stats site

Starting off as a simple match history

## Things to do before publishing

Setting up an API proxy.
Finishing the design for desktop, currently only works well on mobile.

## Planned features

Id like to implement small notes on how each game went. If you had a good KDA a small note saying "Great KDA" and alot of similar and niche notes.
